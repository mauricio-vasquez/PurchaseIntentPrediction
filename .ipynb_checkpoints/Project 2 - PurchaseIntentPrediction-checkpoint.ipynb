Since at the time I was participating on Apziva's AI residency program, I was assigned to perform this task. \n",

On this specific project, they are interested on developing a robust machine learning system that leverages information coming from call center data.\n",

    "Ultimately, The Company is looking for ways to improve the success rate for calls made by their customers (i.e. financial institutions) for marketing purposes, no matter the product the customer offers. Towards this goal they are working on designing an ever evolving machine learning product that offers high success outcomes while offering interpretability for their clients to make informed decisions (from now on, \"The Product\")."

In this context, success means converting calls into sales. The more sales the financial institutions convert, the less their customer acquisition costs will be. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the business problem can be divided into 2 parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <u>From The Company's point of view</u>: Develop an attractive ML product. To be attractive, the product must solve a particular business problem of the target customers. \n",
    "2. <u>From the target customers' point of view</u>: Converting customers is a challenging task (PwC, 2019). Indeed, European financial institutions estimated to lose over €5bn every year on customer acquisition (FinExtra, 2021). For that reason, they need to enhance marketing effectiveness, by decreasing customer acquisition costs. One possible way to achieve better conversion rates may be telemarketing, but it typically needs human intervention and is less massive than other methods. "

    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, digital marketing, although less costly, is impersonal, passive and not as effective as telemarketing to explain complex financial products. Digital banking has the same problems. In that sense, both would need to be complemented with other marketing tactics. Telemarketing may be effective on converting prospects to customers, but if not done in a targeted way, it would result very costly. "

    "**Possible alternatives to solve the business problem:** Since The Company offers Machine Learning (ML) solutions, the scope of the alternatives lie mainly within this activity. Specifically, The Company is suitable to build a predictive lead scoring system, which *assigns a ranking to sales prospects by looking at historical data to determine patterns of won business, and comparing new prospects to the pattern to establish a likelihood of purchase.* (Lewis, 2013, p. 53-55).\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, The Company could try to leverage its knowledge on software development and data analysis to build a simpler heuristics based system. For example, according to Lewis (2013), an alternative to a predictive lead scoring system could be to perform a Qualification-only lead scoring based on a subjective analysis by the marketing and sales teams. Another common approach would be to blend both subjective and predictive lead scoring. \n",
    "\n",
    "To clarify the idea, there are 3 main lead scoring models: qualification-only, interest-only and two-dimensional scoring. Qualification scoring builds a hypothetical ideal customer profile which is more prone to buy the service. Interest scoring uses online behaviour *to gauge a prospect's interest and suitability*. Two-dimensional scoring combines both qualification-only and interest scoring. \n",
    "\n",
    "Within qualification methods, a subjective and/or predictive analysis could be perfomed. The subjectve analysis uses the opinions of the marketing and sales teams to establish the ideal prospect profile. Predictive or objective analysis uses historical data in the way describe before. Although predictive scoring is resource intensive, it could lead to better results than the subjective method (Lewis, 2013)."

However, taking into account that the logistics company needs to know what are the most important questions in its survey, a linear SVM should be the best choice within ML models (50% - 55.6%, depending on the size of the dataset). This suggests that the company might need to balance 2 choices: i) getting more quality data to reach the score it expects; or, ii) keep its current method to predict (un)satisfied customers."
